            The Immaterium (also referred to as the Empyrean, the Aether, the Sea of Souls, the Realm of Chaos,
            Warpspace or most commonly, the Warp) is an alternate dimension of purely psychic energy that echoes and
            underlies the familiar four dimensions of the material universe. It is the source of all psychic powers and
            known instances of so-called "sorcery" or "magic" as well as the home dimension of the Chaos Gods and their
            myriad daemonic servants. In fact, the terms "Chaos" and "the Warp" are often used interchangeably by those
            aware of their existence within the Imperium of Man. Superficially, the Immaterium is Mankind's solution to
            the problem of faster-than-light travel. This function as an FTL medium for interstellar travel is achieved
            because the Immaterium is an extradimensional domain of pure psychic energy, with voidcraft navigating
            between its currents, as in an ocean.
            <br><br>
            The psychic energy that makes up the Immaterium is believed to be the direct result of the existence of
            sentience in the universe, in particular the intelligent species of the Milky Way Galaxy. Considered to be a
            dark reflection of the material universe, the Warp is an ocean of chaotic psychic energy, raw emotion given
            physical form. Stirred by strong emotion and action, the Immaterium is the true Realm of Chaos, home to the
            Dark Gods who comprise the Ruinous Powers and their legions of daemonic followers. The Immaterium is also
            rumoured by many cultures, human and xenos alike, to be the final resting place of the spirits of the dead,
            and therefore can be considered the "Underworld" of the Warhammer 40,000 universe.

        <h3 class="my-3">The Astronomican</h3>
        <p>
            The Astronomican is a psychic homing signal centred upon Terra. It is powered by the continuous mental
            concentration of a thousand psykers. The Astronomican cannot be detected in the real universe -- only in the
            Warp. It is by means of this signal that the Navigators can steer their voidships over long distances. The
            Astronomican's signal is strongest close to Terra and the Emperor of Mankind who is its source and gets
            increasingly weaker further away. It extends over a spherical area with a diameter of about 50,000 light
            years. The Astronomican does not extend to the extreme fringes of the galaxy, and because Terra is situated
            in the galactic West, its signal does not reach a massive swathe of the eastern part of the galaxy at all.
            Nor is the extent or strength of the signal constant -- it can at times be blocked by localised activity
            within the Warp itself. Such activity may be compared to the hurricanes or storms of a terrestrial weather
            system and is known as a Warp Storm. Warp Storms may be so bad, and so long-lasting, that entire star
            systems are isolated for hundreds of standard years at a time.
            <br><br>
            A Warp Storm not only obscures the signal of the Astronomican, it is also dangerous for spacecraft
            travelling nearby. No spacecraft can venture within a Warp Storm and expect to survive, although there are
            tales of miraculous escapes and of starships being thrown tens of thousands of light years off course. Warp
            Storms are not the only dangers within the Warp. There are sentient energies and other immaterial life-forms
            that inhabit it, creatures formed from, and part of, the shifting stuff of the Warp. Few are friendly and
            many are hostile. They are known to Mankind as daemons.

            At that time 12000 slaves who have never
            seen the
            outside of the work galley begins shoveling the dead bodies of the previous workers into massive furnaces
            along
            with whatever hard fuel sources they have in storage, like a brutal Mr. Fusion. A field of pure Psychic FUCK
            YOU
            is generated around the ship the blinded mentally traumatized man inside a metal egg begins screaming
            unendingly as he charts a course throughout the Warp, which is basically a giant ocean of pure emotion in which Unnamed
            Ones lounge around and fuck with humanity by the luxury of simply existing. The ship then ploughs into the
            miasma of what you could call Hell if you lacked imagination. Pray to the Holy Throne the Astropath doesnâ€™t
            accidentally get you lost, become possessed by a Daemon or just explode like a mushy human pinata from the
            mental stress of being around so much pure CANNOT BE. If the void shields even flicker on the 8000 years old
            vessel (which no one actually understands completely how to work) Daemons made of RAPE and LEMON JUICE will
            crawl into our reality and do things you literally cannot imagine to every soul aboard. I mean that. The
            very
            notion of understanding the completeness of the horror the human victims will be witness to would shatter
            your
            perception of reality and cause your heat to explode.
