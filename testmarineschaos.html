    <h1>Chaos Space Marines</h1>

    <p class="mx-5">
        A Chaos Space Marine, also sometimes called a Traitor Marine, a Renegade Marine, or a Heretic Astartes, is a
        former Loyalist Space Marine of the Imperium of Man who has chosen to abandon the service of the Emperor of
        Mankind and dedicate himself to the service of Chaos to achieve his own ends. Such corrupt Astartes normally
        belong to one of the nine original Traitor Legions that betrayed the Emperor during the ancient civil war
        called the Horus Heresy more than 10,000 standard years ago, while others come from Space Marine Chapters
        created long after the Heresy ended that have turned Renegade. Chaos can corrupt Astartes of any time and
        place just as its siren call leads many lesser men to their damnation.
        <br><br>
        During the Horus Heresy, the terrible Imperial civil war that pitted the Battle-Brothers of the 18 known
        Space Marine Legions against one another, there were two factions. These were the Loyalist Space Marines who
        continued to serve the Imperium and the Emperor of Mankind and the Chaos Space Marines of the Traitor
        Legions who betrayed the Emperor and pledged their souls to the service of the four Ruinous Powers of Chaos.
        Some Traitor Marines pledged their service to all four of the Dark Gods, a force known as Chaos Undivided,
        whilst others preferred to dedicate themselves to the worship of only one of the Ruinous Powers. The Traitor
        Legions were led by the Warmaster Horus, once a Primarch of the Imperium and the Emperor's most trusted
        friend, son, and adviser before he was corrupted by the promises and lies of the Dark Gods and his own inner
        flaws and ambition.
        <br><br>
        The Traitor Legions were the most powerful component of the Forces of Chaos which fought during the Heresy,
        which also included the myriad daemons of the Warp, human Traitors from the Imperial Army, the potent
        infantry and combat walker forces of the Dark Mechanicus and Chaos Cultists drawn from across the galaxy.
        The flesh and Power Armour of Chaos Space Marines often warps and twists into new, darker and inhuman forms
        under the influence of the Chaos energies they are exposed to as their shapes morph to embody the corrupted
        Astartes' new allegiance. Chaos Space Marines fight for everything they were once forbidden to indulge in as
        the ascetic servants of the Emperor and the selfless guardians of Mankind. Pleasure, wealth, mayhem, but
        above all else, the power to rule their fellow men in the name of the Chaos Gods is the driving ambition and
        goal of every Chaos Space Marine.
