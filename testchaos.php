    <h1>Chaos</h1>
    <p id="intro-p" class="mx-auto ca blockquote">"What is Chaos? Suffering, you might say. Oppression. Deceit. But
        could not
        all these things be said of your
        Imperium? You hunt down the talented and the strong-willed. You break them or sacrifice them. You lie to
        your citizens and wage war on those who dare speak out. The inquisitors you call masters assume guilt and
        execute millions on a whim. And why? Why do you do this? Because you know Chaos is there but you do not know
        how to fight it, so you crush your own citizens for fear that they might aid the Enemy. The Imperium suffers
        because of Chaos. No matter how hard you fight, that will never change. Chaos exists in a state of permanent
        victory over you - you dance to our tune, mortal one, you butcher and torture and repress one another
        because the gods of the warp require you to. The Imperium is founded on Chaos. My lord Tzeentch won your war
        a long, long time ago."
    </p>
    <p class="mx-5">Chaos is the psychic energy that composes Warp space. More generally, "Chaos" refers to anything
        related to
        Chaos, including its influence, the Gods of Chaos, their followers, and the Warp. Chaos is almost synonymous
        with the Warp - the two concepts are inseparable: Chaos is the limitless ocean of spiritual and emotional
        energy that defines the Warp. It is a great and raw force of change and power, and is both physically and
        spiritually corrupting. The most gifted mortals, psykers, can utilise this energy, thus making them capable
        of abilities which transcend the laws of the material universe. However, the malevolent power of Chaos can
        gradually corrupt a psyker, tainting his mind and body.
        <br><br>
        The iconic symbol of Chaos is the eight-pointed star, representing the infinite possibilities of Chaos.

            <h3>Khorne</h3>
            <h5>The Blood God</h5>
            <h6>God of War, Murder, Battle</h6>
            <p>
                Khorne is the Blood God, an angry and murderous God of Chaos whose bellows of limitless rage echo
                throughout the corridors of time and space. His great brass throne sits upon a mountain of skulls in the
                midst of a plain of splintered bone and lakes of mortal blood formed from the remains of his followers
                slain in battle and those who his minions have killed in his name. Khorne embodies mindless and absolute
                violence, destroying everyone and everything within reach, shedding the blood of friend and foe alike.
                The followers of Khorne are always ferocious warriors and never make use of psychic powers, for the
                Blood God abhors the trickery of magic and cowardly sorcerers, particularly the servants of Tzeentch.
                Men turn to Khorne for the power to conquer, to defeat their enemies in battle, to wreak bloody
                vengeance and to attain unmatched martial prowess against all comers. The most fanatical and dedicated
                of his followers, those whose souls are trapped fully within his bloody embrace, know that he truly
                desires only constant and wild slaughter for its own sake. Khorne cares not from where the blood flows,
                only that it flows without cease for all eternity.

            <h3>Tzeentch</h3>
            <h5>The Changer of the Ways</h5>
            <h6>God of Change, Sorcery, Fate and Hope</h6>
            <p>
                Tzeentch is known by many titles across the galaxy, including the Changer of the Ways, the Master of
                Fortune, the Great Conspirator and the Architect of Fate. He is the Great Sorcerer, the God of Sorcery
                and Change and master of the mutable stream of destiny and time. Tzeentch is, without question, the most
                disturbing and least comprehensible of all the Chaos Gods. His skin crawls with constantly changing
                faces that leer at and mock all who look upon him. When Tzeentch deigns to speak to other beings, these
                faces repeat his words, often with subtle but important differences of intonation and meaning. Plotters
                and schemers find themselves drawn to Tzeentch, especially those who crave psychic or sorcerous power to
                achieve their goals. Politicians and leaders, magisters and Chaos Cultists, all find themselves drawn
                along the convoluted paths of fate, using Tzeentch to achieve their dreams and aspirations, though
                ultimately all are led to play their part in Tzeentch's own eternal schemes. No man can fully comprehend
                the full nature of the intricately-woven, multi-layered plots of Tzeentch and to attempt to do so can
                only lead to insanity. Yet in reality Tzeentch has no grand plan, no ultimate goal to fulfill. For
                Tzeentch the mere act of plotting and entwining the brief fates of mortals is purpose enough. There is
                no end to his scheming for he desires no end to the creation of change. Tzeentch can never achieve any
                ultimate aim for to do so would be the end of ambition and thus the end of the Lord of Destiny.

            <h3>Nurgle</h3>
            <h5>The Plague Lord</h5>
            <h6>God of Death, Disease and Decay</h6>
            <p>
                Nurgle is the mighty Lord of Decay who presides over all physical corruption and morbidity. Disease and
                putrefaction, the inevitable entropic decline of all things, are the favours he bestows upon the
                universe. The God's immense body is bloated with corruption and exudes a sickly, diseased stench. His
                skin is greenish, leathery and necrotic, its surface pock-marked with all of his various boils, running
                sores and favorite infestations. From his exposed guts spill tiny Lesser Daemons, his Nurglings, who
                dine upon the filthy fluids that ooze from Grandfather Nurgle's many festering wounds. It is to free
                themselves from despair -- the eternal mortal dread of disease, starvation and death -- that men turn to
                the Plague Lord. Despite his appearance, he is a warm, welcoming God who prides himself on the
                achievements of his followers, gifting them with his most hideous diseases even as he protects them from
                all pain and the cold sleep of death. The fear of death can be found in the hearts of all the sentient
                beings of the universe, and so there is no shortage of mortals willing to sacrifice their immortal souls
                in return for the corrupted preservation of their physical bodies for all time.

            <h3>Slaanesh</h3>
            <h5>The Prince of Pleasure</h5>
            <h6>God of Pleasure, Sensation and Desire</h6>
            <p>
                Slaanesh is the youngest of the Chaos Gods and alone of all the Ruinous Powers, the Prince of Chaos is
                divinely beautiful. He is as seductive as only an immortal can be, disarming in his innocence, utterly
                beguiling in his manner and irresistibly tempting with his words. Slaanesh can assume male, female or
                hermaphroditic form at will and it is impossible for a mortal to look upon him without losing his soul
                and becoming a slave to the Prince of Pleasure's slightest whim. Mortals that seek charisma and
                fellowship turn to Slaanesh, for his gifts can make one popular and inspiring. Poets and artists are
                drawn into his gaze by the promise of inspiration and fame, while even the hardiest warriors might seek
                the adulation of the masses and the ironclad loyalty of their followers. Yet as one continues in the
                service of Slaanesh, such pleasures soon grow stale and his servants are driven on to search for ever
                greater sensations and ever more self-fulfillment until only the most decadent and debased of acts can
                stir their emotions or provide the pleasure they have come to crave.

            <h3>Chaos Undivided</h3>
            <p>
                Followers of Chaos Undivided venerate Chaos itself, seeing the four major Chaos Gods as a single
                pantheon to be worshipped equally as different emanations of the same universal force. Of all the
                worshippers of Chaos they follow Chaos in its purest form. They can interpret the meaning of Chaos in a
                variety of ways, including as a single God, worship the four major Chaos Gods equally, or favour one
                slightly over the others.
                <br><br>
                The Chaos Lords and Daemon Princes of Chaos Undivided are at an advantage in their ability to unite any
                of the Forces of Chaos under their leadership, even if they would normally worship opposing Gods like
                Khorne and Slaanesh, so the warbands of Chaos Undivided are always the most diverse. The majority of the
                Traitor Legions worship Chaos Undivided, including the feared Black Legion of Abaddon the Despoiler, the
                greatest Champion of Chaos Undivided. Champions of the creed are branded with the Chaos Star, the Mark
                of Chaos Undivided, somewhere upon their bodies. A follower of Chaos Undivided may also honour the
                lesser daemonic entities of the Warp if they are likely to aid him.
