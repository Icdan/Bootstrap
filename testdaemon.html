        </p>
        <p> "A Daemon, also known as a Neverborn amongst the Forces of Chaos, is an intelligent and usually malevolent
            entity of the Warp that is a living embodiment of Chaos. Daemons are collectively the greatest servants of
            the Chaos Gods and of Chaos itself as a universal force. They are created at the whim of one of the four
            major Chaos Gods from a fraction of the god's own power within the Immaterium and act as an extension of his
            will. A daemon's appearance and intrinsic character reflect the god's own nature. These daemons may be
            reabsorbed into the god's own psychic signature in the Warp at his whim.
            <br><br>
            The Chaos Gods are not alone in Warpspace. They have created servants from their own essences -- the
            creatures that mortals have named daemons based on their ancient legends and religious mythologies -- who
            are not so closely bound to the Warp. Daemons are entities of a somewhat different nature to their masters,
            and are the most numerous of the creatures to be found in the Empyrean. A daemon is "born" when a Chaos God
            expends a portion of its own power to create a separate being. This psychic power binds a collection of
            senses, thoughts and purposes together, creating a personality and consciousness that can move within the
            Warp. The Chaos God can reclaim the independence it has given to its daemon children at any time, thus
            ensuring their loyalty. It is only though the loss of this power that a daemon can truly be destroyed, its
            mind dissolving into the whirls and currents of Warpspace.
            <br><br>
            As minions of the Chaos Gods, most daemons lack self-will, at least as humanity understands it. Instead,
            they serve only to spread the aims of their masters. For example, a daemon of Khorne seeks only battle, and
            wages war upon other daemons with the same fervour as it does upon mortals. Daemons seemingly spend much of
            their existence in conflict with other daemons, as each of the Chaos Gods seeks to expand its power and
            influence as part of the Great Game. It is only when the mortal world is involved that daemons tend to band
            together and cooperate, and even then, such alliances are short-lived, as each of the four Chaos lords seeks
            to prevent the other from gaining any sort of advantage."
