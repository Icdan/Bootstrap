        The C'tan or Star Gods (in the Eldar Lexicon they are called the Yngir) are said to be the oldest
        intelligent beings in existence in the Milky Way Galaxy. It is said that they were created at the very
        beginning of the universe, spawned from swirling gases and enormous amounts of energy, and as such are
        etheric creatures by nature. In their natural form they are vast beings and spread themselves over the
        surface of a star, absorbing its solar energy to feed themselves. After a time, they learned to use
        diaphanous wings to travel to other stars to continue their consumption when their host star died. The
        matter around them was so insignificant that it did not register on their voracious appetite. They are able
        to interact with the physical world thanks to the technology of the Necrontyr which transferred their
        consciousnesses into robotic bodies made of the living metal called Necrodermis. The C'tan used the hatred
        of the Necrontyr towards the ancient species called the Old Ones to help them gather the more appetizing
        energy of living beings that they came to crave.
        <br><br>
        The C'tan hate the Warp and its psychic energies (even as they crave the living energies of organic beings)
        and had the Necrons construct a series of pylons on the world of Cadia and other planets across several
        sectors in the Segmentum Obscurus which, when completed, were intended to close off the Warp from the
        material universe entirely, utterly destroying any living creatures with a soul, leaving all other life in
        the galaxy as nourishment for the C'tan.
        <br><br>
        It was the C'tan who designed the process of bio-transference for the Necrontyr, transferring their
        proteges' consciousnesses into undying mechanical bodies composed of Necrodermis. However, the
        biotransference process also transformed the Necrontyr into the Necrons, soulless beings who have difficulty
        taking pleasure in anything and who can never truly enjoy their immortality. After the end of the War in
        Heaven against their ancient foes the Old Ones, the Necrons, led by the Silent King Szarekh, successfully
        rebelled against their C'tan Star Gods. Those C'tan who survived the revolt were broken into fragments known
        as C'tan Shards that were more easily contained and imprisoned within arcane Necron devices known as
        Tesseract Labyrinths. At present, since the Necrons' Great Awakening began in the mid-41st Millennium, these
        C'tan Shards are deployed when needed as the Necron Dynasties' greatest weapons on the battlefield. However,
        there always exists the possibility that the imprisoned C'tan will escape their captors. Then they will
        wreak a terrible vengeance upon their captors and the innocent alike...
