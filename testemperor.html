    <h1>God-Emperor of Mankind</h1>
    <p id="intro-p" class="mx-auto ca blockquote">"Our thoughts light the Darkness that others may cross space<br>
        We are one with the Emperor, our souls are joined in his will<br>
        Praise the Emperor whose sacrifice is life as ours is death<br>
        Hail his name the Master of Humanity"<br>

    <p class="my-3 mx-5">
        The Emperor is the collective reincarnation of all the shamans of Neolithic humanity's various peoples, the
        first human psykers. The foul Warp entities that would become the four Great Powers of Chaos had not yet
        fully formed when the Emperor was born on Earth during prehistoric times, somewhere in ancient central
        Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 8th Millennium B.C. But even before the birth of the Emperor, as humanity
        grew and progressed, the Warp began to become increasingly disturbed by the dark undercurrents of humanity's
        collective psyche, and the shamans began to lose their former ability to reincarnate into new bodies.
        Instead, upon dying, their souls were consumed by the entities and daemons of the Warp. Eventually the
        shamans of humanity, unable to reincarnate, would become extinct, and without the shamans and their psychic
        abilities to guide the race, humanity would inevitably fall prey to the corruptions of Chaos, just as
        eventually happened to the Eldar. In these ancient days, all the shamans of Earth gathered in a grand
        conclave to decide what must be done to stave off the day when they had all been consumed by the Warp.
        <br><br>
        In the end, the shamans decided to pool their collective psychic energies by reincarnating as a single soul
        in a single human body to create an individual they called "the New Man." The thousands of shamans, as one,
        took poison, and as one, they died, their souls flowing into the Immaterium in a rush of psychic power that
        overwhelmed those daemons who sought to feast upon it with a cleansing, purifying fire, a flame imperishable
        that became one soul out of many. A standard year later the child who would become the Emperor was born in a
        Neolithic settlement of Anatolian herders and farmers of a normal mother and father, with normal brothers
        and sisters. His psychic power was so great that its energies altered His genome and physiology in the womb
        and rendered Him immortal so He would no longer need to reincarnate and could not be assaulted by the
        daemonic creatures of the Immaterium upon His death. As He grew older, His potent psychic powers began to
        manifest.
        <br><br>
        For thirty-eight thousand Terran years, He wandered over the Earth and throughout human history. He
        travelled among the different peoples of Mankind. While He had first been only an observer of Mankind's
        triumphs and follies, He soon began to help where He could, using His ancient wisdom to spread efficient
        government, crop management, animal husbandry, technology and peace. He used His influence carefully, at
        first adopting only the guise of a normal man, and without revealing His true nature.
        <br><br>
        As the millennia passed, the man who would become the Emperor watched the human race develop. He travelled
        the entire globe, watching and helping, sometimes adopting the persona of a great leader or advisor. In
        times of trouble He became a crusader, a religious leader or even a messiah, at other times He remained a
        back-stage contributor to events, an advisor to kings, a court magician, a pioneering scientist. Many of the
        guises He adopted were humble, others became monumental figures of world history or religion. At times of
        crisis He would be there, steering the human race along a narrow path to survival that only He could see.
        <br><br>
        As the human race prospered the Warp became increasingly disturbed. The man who would become the Emperor was
        aware of how the extreme sides of the human character were feeding the nascent Chaos Powers. Despite His
        best efforts to promote peace and harmony across Old Earth, the instinctive values of martial honour,
        ambition, defiance, and self-satisfaction could never be eradicated from the human character. Some of the
        New Man's plans proved less than successful; seeds of wisdom often failed to flourish or grew into
        uncontrollable monstrosities leading to eras of persecution and war.
        <br><br>
        The Chaos Powers sensed the presence of the New Man, the "Anathema" as they would name him, and His efforts
        to curb their own power and growth. Even before they became fully conscious in the Immaterium the Ruinous
        Powers recognised the man who would become the Emperor as their greatest enemy. Khorne was the first of the
        four major Chaos Gods to wake fully, and an era of wars and conflict soon raged across the globe to herald
        his birth. Tzeentch was the next, and nations and politics soon grew to maturity with all of their implicit
        intrigues and double-dealings. Nurgle was the third to awake and plagues swept across Old Earth's continents
        claiming many souls for the Lord of Decay. By the end of the European Middle Ages on Terra, all three of
        these Chaos Gods had awoken to full consciousness. The fourth, Slaanesh, still slumbered, to be awakened by
        the follies of a different species, the Aeldari.
        <br><br>
        But as the New Man's psychic powers further developed, He became ever more aware of the terrible dangers
        that awaited Mankind in the broader universe and He resolved to do all in His power to defend and guide
        humanity towards a future as the predominant species in the galaxy. As more and more humans were born with
        the mutant psyker genes that granted them the ability to wield the potent power of the Immaterium in the
        last centuries of the Dark Age of Technology, and humanity suffered from the deadly effects of uncontrolled
        psykers that heralded the onset of the Age of Strife, the Emperor realised that He would have to take a more
        direct and open role in human affairs than ever before. Following the birth of Slaanesh after the Fall of
        the Eldar in the 30th Millennium, and the end of the Warp Storms that had prevented interstellar
        communications and travel from the Sol System, the Emperor determined that the time had come to directly
        steer the history of Mankind once more, or see the human race ultimately go extinct.
